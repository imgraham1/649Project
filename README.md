# Airbnb Data Visualization Project
Check out the finished product: https://imgraham1.github.io/Airbnb_data_viz_project/

This project explores Airbnb's growth in NYC through a series of interactive visualizations made using Plotly, Tableau, and Altair.<br><br>
We used over 10 years worth of data on Airbnbs in NYC as well as historical rent data to uncover any potential relationships. Additionally, we chose to pay close attention to time periods near new policies and/or legislation being introduced that would effect Airbnb or rent in the city.<br><br>

The initial exploratory data analysis, cleaning, and manipulation was done in Python mostly using Pandas
